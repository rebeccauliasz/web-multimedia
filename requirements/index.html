<li>
<p><strong>Attendance, Labs, and Participation:</strong> 30%</p>
<p>Success in this course hinges upon your consistent skill-building.  New material will be presented in lecture and in lab, and you will complete weekly lab assignments that will give you hands-on experience grappling with the concepts and grammar necessary to create modern web pages.  Your full participation is required, including attendance in all lectures and lab sessions, as well as participating in the peer support and troubleshooting community on Piazza.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<li>
<p><strong>Midterm Project:</strong> 25%<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Due: TBA</p>
<p>The Midterm Project's overall site architecture will be designed in early lab assignments, and its design and layout refined over the first month and 1/2 of the course.  The outcome will be a multipage HTML5 website with CSS layout and design that introduces the student to the class and serves as an archive of lab assignments that will be completed throughout the semester.  The Midterm Project will, by the end of the term, also link to the student's final project proposal, final project itself, as well as accompanying documentation / post-project reflection.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Final Project Proposal:</strong> 10%<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Due: TBA</p>
<p>Following the completion of the Midterm Project, students are expected to formulate a proposal outlining their intentions and aspirations for a Final Project site.  Proposals will include: a description of and rationale for the site's genre; a collection of URLs that provide inspiration for content or design; wireframes for page mockup; proposed color palette; and description of multimedia and interactive elements.  Proposal should also identify two or more &ldquo;reach goals.&ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Final Project:</strong> 35%<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Due: TBA</p>
<p>The final project for the course is an accessible, interactive website that uses valid HTML, CSS, and Javascript of a genre (design portfolio, web documentary, webXR experience, interactive storytelling, or a company, product, hobby, thesis, or project website) and aesthetic of the student's choice, in consultation with and with approval of lab instructors.  Final projects will be accompanied by a one-page site self-assessment / post-mortem reflection.</p>

<h2 id="recommended-software">Recommended Software</h2>
<p>The software recommended for the course is either freely available to all or free to you as a Duke student.  We will use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> or <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> web browser — Sorry diehard Safari or Internet Explore/Edge fans . . .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>, a text editor designed for web development and available for Mac, Windows, and Linux systems.  [But yes, you can use your text editor or IDE (integrated development environment) of choice here.  But there are some nifty features in Brackets that you may find useful and time-saving.]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1">FileZilla</a>, a file transfer program for uploading your files to a web server.  If you have a preferred alternative, it must support SFTP.   Note:  Please download FileZilla directly from the link above.  Downloading from the FileZilla homepage or “download” menu link unfortunately defaults to a “sponsored” download that includes adware/bloatware.  Yuck!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github Desktop</a> - This is highly recommended if you are new to Git, but those with experience may prefer a different Git GUI or using Git via command line.  [Wait a minute….What the heck is Git and Github??  No worries, we’ll discuss everything in class, but this article offers a concise and clear explanation:  <a href="https://codeburst.io/number-one-piece-of-advice-for-new-developers-ddd08abc8bfa">Brandon Morelli's &ldquo;New Developer? You Should've Learned Git Yesterday&rdquo;</a> ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adobe Creative Cloud (optional) - All Duke students are eligible for a <a href="https://software.duke.edu/node/272">free subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud through the OIT Software portal</a>. It is also available in the OIT <a href="https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/services/multimedia-project-studio">Multimedia Project Studio (MPS)</a> which is staffed with student consultants.</p>
